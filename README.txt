README

The git contains a couple scripts I made for downloading songs from my Spotify account. The songs are downloaded from youtube.

The git is inspired by the functionality of DJay Pro and its song matching feature that uses the Spotify API.

To use these scripts you need

A Spotify Developer account and token
python
Spotipy
Youtube-dl 
Mutagen
Beautiful soup

Change the token to your Spotify developer token in Lisas mixtape to download a playlist from youtube.

The script is initialised to test the accuracy of the playlist generator compared to Djay Pro.
